# Intelligent-Intrusion-detection-based-on-Deep-Learning-Approach
Our network intrusion detection system (NIDS), which is built on the Convolution neural network (CNN) and the Correlation feature selection (CFS). It has been trained and tested on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The cybersecurity database CICIDS2018, which is utilised to train the suggested model, is first introduced and examined. Before the data is supplied into intrusion detection, the data is preprocessed to guarantee its quality. The second step involves applying the correlation-based feature selection method to extract the datasetâ€™s best feature subset. Finally, the architecture and mathematical model of the CNN, which receives the processed data for classification.
